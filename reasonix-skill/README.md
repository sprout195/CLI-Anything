# CLI-Anything for Reasonix

An adapter that brings the [CLI-Anything](https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything) harness methodology to the [Reasonix](https://reasonix.ai) coding agent.

CLI-Anything (42.1k+ stars) is a methodology for making **any GUI software agent-native** by generating stateful CLI harnesses with REPL mode, JSON output, undo/redo, and comprehensive tests. This adapter lets Reasonix act as the builder agent.

## Installation

### Option 1: One-liner via Reasonix Skill API (Recommended)

If you have a running Reasonix session, just ask:

> "Install the cli-anything skill"

Or programmatically, Reasonix's `install_skill` will place the skill at `~/.reasonix/skills/cli-anything.md`.

### Option 2: Shell Install Script

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git
cd CLI-Anything/reasonix-skill
./scripts/install.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git
cd CLI-Anything\reasonix-skill
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

Both scripts copy the skill to `$REASONIX_HOME/skills/cli-anything` (defaults to `~/.reasonix/skills/cli-anything`).

## Usage

After installation, invoke the skill in any Reasonix session:

```
/cli-anything https://github.com/GNOME/gimp
```

Or via the `run_skill` API:

```
run_skill({ name: "cli-anything", arguments: "/path/to/software" })
```

### What It Does

The skill spawns an isolated Reasonix sub-agent that follows the CLI-Anything 7-phase methodology:

1. **Codebase Analysis** — Surveys the target software's architecture, data model, and API surface
2. **CLI Architecture Design** — Designs command groups, state model, and output formats
3. **Implementation** — Generates a Click-based Python CLI with REPL, JSON output, and session state
4. **Test Planning** — Creates TEST.md with comprehensive test plan
5. **Test Implementation** — Writes unit tests and E2E tests with real backend invocation
6. **Test Documentation** — Runs all tests and documents results
7. **PyPI Packaging** — Creates setup.py and verifies `pip install -e .`

### Example

```bash
# Build a CLI for GIMP from local source
/cli-anything /home/user/gimp

# Build from a GitHub repo
/cli-anything https://github.com/blender/blender

# Refine an existing harness
/cli-anything:refine /home/user/gimp "batch processing and Script-Fu filters"
```

## Reasonix Tool Mapping

| CLI-Anything Need | Reasonix Tool |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Shell execution | `bash` |
| File generation | `write_file` |
| Code editing | `edit_file` / `multi_edit` |
| Source reading | `read_file` |
| Codebase search | `grep` / `glob` / `ls` |
| Architecture analysis | `mcp__codegraph__*` |
| Parallel subtasks | `task` |
| Documentation fetch | `web_fetch` |

## How It Compares to Other Agent Adapters

| Feature | Claude Code | Codex | Hermes | **Reasonix** |
|---------|------------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Skill format | `.claude-plugin/` | `SKILL.md` + YAML | `SKILL.md` + YAML | `SKILL.md` + YAML |
| Shell | `bash` | `terminal` | `terminal` | `bash` |
| File ops | native | `execute_code` | `execute_code` / `write_file` | `write_file` / `edit_file` / `multi_edit` |
| Code analysis | file reads | file reads | file reads | `mcp__codegraph__*` (symbol graph) |
| Parallelism | — | — | `delegate_task` | `task` (sub-agents) |
| Install method | `/plugin install` | `install.sh` → `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` | `install.sh` → `$HERMES_HOME/skills/` | `install_skill` API or `install.sh` → `~/.reasonix/skills/` |
